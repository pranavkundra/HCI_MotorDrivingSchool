We are a driving school establishment since 2005 servicing all throughout central Gotham. Our headquarter office is located in Old Town. Our expertise focuses on 16 year old teens obtaining their permit and beginner adults learning to be independent and confident drivers on the road. </p>
 
<h3>Safety First!</h3>
 
<p> 
At ABS Driving School, the team strives to work diligently and persistently more than any other driving school to keep our students safe. It is crucial to keep in mind the rules of defense driving while operating a vehicle among other drivers on the road. Our instructors will teach you the best possible ways to drive with focus and defense.
 
 
Driving may seem very normal to people today, but the reality of driving can be very dangerous even if you’re the one to be guiltless while others may be above the influence, speeding, or not paying attention to traffic rules.
 
 
Our instructors do not just teach the basics of driving. We care about our student driver’s safety. We teach crucial observations to be kept with them for the rest of their driving future. This is just one of many U.S driving school's principals. </p>
 
<h3>Is driving complicated?</h3>
 
<p>
Just like anything else, nothing is complicated to accomplish when you've set your mind to it. It is vital to learn certain techniques that will help guide you to a safe and comfortable travel. Our instructors will teach you those things in the best manner possible.
 
Often, in the beginning students may have fear of getting behind the wheel. With our highly trained instructors, U.S Driving School guarantees the best motivation towards our students to get up and drive. We make sure of your comfort.</p>
